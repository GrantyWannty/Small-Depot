Minecraft Railway Empire -=- Small Depot
============================
Welcome to my Github structures! Either from visiting here, or linked by my youtube channel, you can find all my Minecraft Create structures, based off of the game Railway Empire.
I try to put as much detail as I can in these to be as closly related to the actual structures

This structure is the Small Depot, as least what I call it. It is technically the Small Train Station, but instead of the city, it's a rural station.
This structure is what loads your trains with goods produced in the country.
